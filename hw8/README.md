The config file needs an extra space beneath the last line. Otherwise it does not read in the last line.

I was not able to fully finish the AI, and so the game does not run with them and place moves. However, my algorithm for finding all the moves (and then finding the best in it), works. I was very close to finishing but in the end just did not have enought time.
