I did the code buy and used the code given to us for HW4


The config file needs an extra space beneath the last line. Otherwise it does not read in the last line.
This is because of the code given to use in the code buy, and it is how they read in lines. The CP said
we do not need to worry about this because we were provided with this code.

I was not able to fully finish the AI, and so the game does not run with them and place moves. However, my algorithm for finding all the moves (and then finding the best in it), almost works. I was very close to finishing but in the end just did not have enought time. I would love some partial credit because I know I could get it working with a little bit more time and fixing the small kinks. 

Lastly, the code buy made it kind of hard, since they did the indexing very different than I did. That is the cause of a lot of the issues with finding the correct words that can be placed.
