This project has a few files, and most of the work is done in Move.cpp. All of the actual moves, and the handeling of the tiles on the board is done in move.cpp. The player and board classes are used to help implement the game. 

The scoring does not take multipliers into account, but other than that it works accuratley. I can also place tiles and exchange them. Everything works decently well.
